        <h2> Page 1</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Line 22:</b> This line was missing a closing list tag so I added one to the end of the line.</li>
            <li><b>Line 29:</b> This line was missing a closing paragraph tag so I added a closing p tag to the end of that line.</li>
            <li><b>Line 34:</b> This line was missing a closing td tag so I added it to the end of the line.</li>
            <li><b>Line 42:</b> A table element starting in line 31 was not closed so I added a closing tag to line 42</li>
            <li><b>Line 26:</b> Line 26 did not have the correct directions to get to the image so “img/“ needed to be added before the name of the image so that the folder where image.jpeg is stored could be accessed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Page 2</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Line 26:</b> The b element was missing a “/b” in the b closing tag so I added that.</li>
            <li><b>Line 52:</b> This line should not use the b element on headings so it was removed.</li>
            <li><b>Line 56:</b> There was a bad value for the attrubute href in element "a" so I got rid of the value since there was no working link to add instead.</li>
            <li><b>Line 73:</b> The header for "History" was oddly small compared to the rest of the page so I changed it to h3 instead of h6. </li>
        </ul>

    <section>
        <h2> Page 3</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Line 1:</b> This page was missing the documents type so I added “!DOCTYPE html” to line 1.</li>
            <li><b>Lines 4-8</b> here was no title, meta or link to a css stylesheet so I added them in lines 4-8.</li>
            <li><b>Line 37:</b> Based on the About Section paragraph content, it did not make sense to have these 4 sentences in 2 different paragraphs. I got rid of two of the p tags in the second paragraph to make the 4 sentences into one.</li>
            <li><b>Cars.css line 66:</b> I deleted “position: absolute;” in line 66 of the css style sheet so that the footer box on page 3 would be placed at the bottom of the page and would not overlap with other content on page 3.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Page 4</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Line 1:</b> This page was missing the documents type so I added “!DOCTYPE html” to line 1.</li>
            <li><b>Lines 36, 37, 38, 41,42, 43, 46, 47, 48:</b> All img elements must have an alt attribute to go with it so that if the image cannot be seen then there is an explanation of what it should look like. I added alt attributes to each of these lines explaining the image.</li>
            <li><b>Lines 37, 42, 47:</b> In each of these lines a td tag or two were missing from the code. I added them to the start of lines 42 and 47 and added closing tags to line 37 and 42.</li>
            <li><b>Lines 35-48:</b> The images were arranged in a very confusing way on the page so I rearranged the image elements so that they would align nicely on the page in clear columns under their correct subject headers.</li>
